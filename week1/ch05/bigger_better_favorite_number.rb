# We ask for the number, add one to it, and suggest it as a better one

puts "Hey there! What's your favorite number?"
favNum = gets.chomp.to_i

betterNum = favNum + 1

puts "Hmm... " + favNum.to_s + " is ok I guess, but don't you think " + betterNum.to_s + " would make for a bit of better favorite number?"
